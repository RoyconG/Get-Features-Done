**Requirement Format:**
- ID: `[CATEGORY]-[NUMBER]` (AUTH-01, CONTENT-02, SOCIAL-03)
- Description: User-centric, testable, atomic
- Checkbox: Only for v1 requirements (v2 are not yet actionable)

**Categories:**
- Derive from research FEATURES.md categories
- Keep consistent with domain conventions
- Typical: Authentication, Content, Social, Notifications, Moderation, Payments, Admin

**v1 vs v2:**
- v1: Committed scope, will be mapped to features
- v2: Acknowledged but deferred, not in current feature set
- Moving v2 → v1 requires feature creation

**Out of Scope:**
- Explicit exclusions with reasoning
- Prevents "why didn't you include X?" later
- Anti-features from research belong here with warnings

**Traceability:**
- Empty initially, populated during feature creation
- Each requirement maps to exactly one feature
- Unmapped requirements = feature gap

**Status Values:**
- Pending: Not started
- In Progress: Feature is active
- Complete: Requirement verified
- Blocked: Waiting on external factor

</guidelines>

<evolution>

**After each feature completes:**
1. Mark covered requirements as Complete
2. Update traceability status
3. Note any requirements that changed scope

**After feature set updates:**
1. Verify all v1 requirements still mapped
2. Add new requirements if scope expanded
3. Move requirements to v2/out of scope if descoped

**Requirement completion criteria:**
- Requirement is "Complete" when:
  - Feature is implemented
  - Feature is verified (tests pass, manual check done)
  - Feature is committed
